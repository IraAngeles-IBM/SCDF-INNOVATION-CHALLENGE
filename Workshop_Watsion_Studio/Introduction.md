# Data Science Starter Kit


## Chapter 1 Introduction

This workshop is an introduction to Watson Studio, the IBM platform for data science and artificial intelligence. Completing the exercises does not require any specific skills or knowledge. At the end of this session you should be able to use the product on your own.

In this workshop, we will:

- Setup your Watson Studio Cloud account

- Prepare data using Data Refinery

- Build and Deploy models in Jupyter Notebooks to detect fraud

- Create a model using AutoAI

- Create a model using the SPSS canvas

To begin, please [clone the relevant data files](https://github.com/zacaintmyname/CFCImages) that would be the baseline for to following workshop exercises.
